Alright. Let's try this.

LE1 Community Patch
Myriad Pro Begone - Must be installed after the Community Patch, so all good. You can optionally change the dialogue wheel color to orange.
Advanced Weapon Models - Needed for Diversification Project
Halcyon Hairpack - Needed for Diversification Project
Appearance Modification Menu
Streamlined Weapon Loadouts - Has a patch for Advanced Weapon Models
Elements of Comparative Weaponry
Pinnacle Station DLC
Private Message Terminal
A Little Help From My Friends - Requires Private Message Terminal, so all good.
Eclectic Emails - Requires Private Message Terminal, so all good.
ME1 Dossiers Restored - Requires Private Message Terminal, so all good.
Alliance Uniform Consitency - Requires Community Patch. Has a patch for Casual Hubs and Saren Stages.
Casual Hubs - The default options are good.
Black Market License
Return to Normandy Button
Normandy Rapid Transit
Skip Minigames
Charted Worlds
Galaxy Map Trackers
Mission Timings
N7 Mako
XP Rescale
Keepers Finders - Has a patch for Diversification Project and Alliance Uniform Consistency
Dr. Heart Experiments
Alternate Feros Claw Cutscene
Geth Retrofits - Requires Appearance Modification Menu. Advanced Weapon Models recommended.
Tali Consistency Mod - One of those cases we discussed earlier. Depending on whether you want to install the ALOT textures later or if you use Liara Consistency Project and Casual Hubs you need a different combo patch. It's not confusing or anything just a touch obtuse.
Liara Consistency Mod - Has a patch for Alliance Uniform Consistency, Tali Consistency Mod and Casual Hubs
Mira Please Be Quiet
Remove Feros Color Filter - Has a patch for MELLO
Saren Stages - If you want to use Diversification Project stay with the default option.
MELLO
Smoother GUI - Has a patch for Myriad Pro Begone and Pinnacle Station DLC. For the Myriad Pro Begone patch you need to remember which color you picked, default or orange.
LE1 Diversification Project - Requires the Community Patch, Advanced Weapon Models and Halcyon Hairpack. Has a patch for Alliance Uniform Consistency, MELLO, Appearance Modification Menu and Saren Stages. You need to choose whether you want Saren in Robes or Armor during the Prologue and Council call but that is flavor; The important part I mentioned in Saren Stages.
A Lot Of Videos
