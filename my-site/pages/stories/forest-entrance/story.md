# Forest Entrance

The mild evening wind gently flows around you.

Through the canopy of nearby trees, the light of a waxing moon breaks through and illuminates the beginning of what you know will be a long and trying path.

You've stood here many times before, trying to talk yourself into taking that first fateful step.

So far, it hasn't worked. But something about tonight feelsâ€¦ different.

You're not ignorant of how perilous this path can be; you have seen countless others tread it. Some persisted; some didn't.

Honestly, you probably have no idea just how trying this path will be.

But you cannot let fear stay your feet any longer.

No particular thing prompted this burst of resolve... or so you think.

In truth, it is the culmination of all those times you stood in this exact same spot and decided to turn around.

Every time, your resolve grew a little bit more. And though it took a long while to get here, you find that it doesn't actually matter that you needed the extra time.

There is no guide for this. Everyone's experience is unique, and everyone goes in their own time.

Truly, the worst thing you can do is suppress the impulse. Let it grow and fester until you cannot take it anymore.

That is when you will find yourself right here, at the entrance to a forest so big no one is really sure if it even has an end.

Tonight, with one more deep, shaky breath, you take that first step into the forest. And for better or worse, you will not return the same.
